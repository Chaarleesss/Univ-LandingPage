              <h3>Harvard University</h3>
              <p>Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.
                  Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard
                  , it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings
                  have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.</p>
                  <p>Harvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature,
                      "dreading
                      to leave an
                      illiterate ministry to the churches, when our present ministers shall lie in the dust"; though never
                      formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years Harvard College primarily trained
                      Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th
                      century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural
                      institution among the Boston elite.Following the American Civil War, under President
                      Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional
                      schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the
                      Association of American Universities.James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression
                      and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.</p>

                          university is composed of ten academic
                          faculties plus Harvard Radcliffe Institute.
                          The
                          Faculty
                          of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic
                          disciplines,
                          and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three
                          main campuses: the 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus
                          immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in
                          Boston's Longwood Medical Area.Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.9 billion, making it the
                          wealthiest academic institution in the world. Endowment income enables the undergraduate college
                          to admit students regardless of financial need and provide generous financial aid with no
                          loans.Harvard
